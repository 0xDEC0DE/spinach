Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What is the licence?
--------------------

Spinach is released under the :download:`BSD license <../../LICENSE>`.

Should I use Spinach?
---------------------

Spinach is a very young software, if your business depends heavily on
background tasks you should probably go with Celery or RQ.

That being said, Spinach relies on proven technologies (Redis, Python queues,
thread pools...) and is heavily tested.
